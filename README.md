# sharecloud

sharecloud is a PHP project to provide filehosting features for private users and their friends.

# Requirements

Currently we support all webspace servers, virtual servers (vServer) and all root servers. There should be no problems if you can fulfil following requirements:

* PHP 5.3.2+
* MySQL 5+ (or MariaDB)
* Apache 2 Webserver (other servers are not officially supported but should work with some tweaks)

Optional
* php-imagick
* php-rar

# Installation
We provide some installation guides [here](docs/install/installation.md).

# Unofficial guides
We also provide guides for those who want to use different software (like nginx) [here](docs/recipes/recipes.md)

# Contribution
Feel free to contribute to this project by creating pull-requests and opening issues.
